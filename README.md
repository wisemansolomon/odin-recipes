This project is to get my hands dirty with HTML especially with lists (ordered and unordered) and apply all I have learnt about HTML. Although i already have prior HTML exposure, my intention is to also be comfortable using Git while at it.

In this project I am going to build a recipe website and to solidify my understanding of CSS later on with same project.

https://www.allrecipes.com/ was used for recipes for this project.
